This is a chrome app that demonstrates some html5 fullscreen API broken-ness in chrome apps.

1) Try scrolling the page before and after clicking "requestFullscreen" button.
  You won't be able to after you have clicked the button.

2) document.webkitFullscreenEnabled = true, although neither the chrome app has
  "fullscreen" permission nor it can/will go fullscreen.

3) "requestFullscreen" results in a console warn:
  "Is the 'app.window.fullscreen' permission appropriate? See http://developer.chrome.com/apps/declare_permissions.html.",
  great, however we should also be dispatching a "webkitfullscreenerror" event.
